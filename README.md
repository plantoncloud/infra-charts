# PlantonCloud Infra Quick Start Bundles

This repository contains Quick Start Bundles designed to simplify the onboarding and provisioning of cloud
infrastructure resources. Quick Start Bundles provide predefined, composable sets of resources to rapidly deploy common
cloud scenarios, enhancing the developer experience by abstracting complex configurations while preserving flexibility.

## Purpose

Quick Start Bundles help development teams quickly set up cloud infrastructure through simplified initial provisioning.
After deployment, resources within these bundles can be managed individually, offering both ease of use and long-term
flexibility.

## Available Bundles

Currently available Quick Start Bundles:

- [AWS ECS Quick Start Bundle](aws-ecs/README.md): Provides streamlined provisioning for AWS ECS services.

Additional bundles for other cloud providers and services will be added over time.

## How to Use

1. Select a Quick Start Bundle relevant to your needs.
2. Follow the bundle-specific README for configuration parameters and deployment instructions.

## Important Considerations

- Quick Start Bundles are intended solely for initial provisioning.
- Individual resource management post-deployment should follow standard practices.
